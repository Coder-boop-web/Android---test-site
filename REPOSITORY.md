This repository is not a complete fork of the original repository "IamChristianS/v1." Instead, it contains files that have been selectively moved from "IamChristianS/v1" to create a distinct collection of resources.

To clarify, a fork typically implies that the entire repository, along with its complete history and structure, is duplicated to allow for independent development. In contrast, this repository does not replicate the entire project or its commit history. Instead, it features only specific files that have been transferred from "IamChristianS/v1" for the purpose of focusing on particular aspects or functionalities.

By moving these files, we aim to streamline the project and tailor it to specific needs or objectives, rather than maintaining a full copy of the original repository. This approach allows for a more targeted development process while acknowledging the source of the files.
